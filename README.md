# Foundation Programmes

## What is this

This is a Python script to generate a CSV for [NHS Foundation Programmes](https://www.oriel.nhs.uk/Web/Programme/GetProgramme/L085MXN4K1NSeFI3cnBEYTVWM24zeUpOSUJmaGRqZXhlVDVySXNrZytOVUpRdXRQK0dpWFZGWXoxVkIvSmNPRg). The script is specialised for the input data and is not designed to be robust for any inputâ€”it just needed to work.

5) Finish import.
6) Select whole table (control/command + A).
7) Insert > Table.
8) Select "My table has headers".
9) Ignore warnings and finish.
10) Complete.
